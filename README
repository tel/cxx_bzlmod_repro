- Note that in the `MODULE.bazel.lock` file, at paths similar the example below 
  we see a referenced label like 
  `@@[unknown repo '' requested from @@cxx.rs~]//third-party/bazel:BUILD.unicode-width-0.1.12.bazel`.


  ```
  "@@cxx.rs~//tools/bazel:extension.bzl%crate_repositories" 
  -> "general" 
  -> "generatedRepoSpecs" 
  -> "vendor_unicode-with-0.1.12" 
  -> "attributes"
  -> "build_file"
  ```

- If you delete the `MODULE.bazel.lock` file and run 
  `bazel build @cxx.rs//:codegen` it will recreate the lockfile with this 
  anomaly and then fail
- Attempting to run any build command when the lockfile is in this state will crash the Bazel server
